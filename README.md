# CIST 1400-001, Spring 2026

This code is used in CIST 1400, "Introduction to Computer Science I", at the [University of Nebraska at Omaha](http://unomaha.edu).

The in-person course meetings use a [Peer Instruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_instruction) model, where small bits of code or a concept is presented in multiple choice questions to the class. The class as a whole takes a first vote using a polling system ([Poll Everywhere](http://pollev.com/) for this course) and the results are then evaluated by the instructor to determine the next step:

Class Results | Next Step
:-- | :--
&lt; 30% | Just-in-time (JIT) teaching is used to clarify the material. A second vote is sometimes taken to evaluate new understanding of the material after that JIT teaching.
30% to 79% | The class breaks up into small groups of 2-4 students to discuss the question for 4-6 minutes. The question is presented again and the class votes on the question a second time to evaluate student understanding after those discussions.
&ge; 80% | Some clarifying discussion is had by the instructor about the correct answer as well as why the other answers are incorrect and then the next question or activity is presented.

The code included in this repo is from the questions presented as well as any additional code generated during discussions of the lecture content.

Some lectures have summaries of the topics discussed during that lecture.

Content is initialy presented in the textbook using the [zyBooks](http://learn.zybooks.com/) platform. Relevant sections of the textbook should be completed before coming to class.

Guidance for students who may not be familiar with a GitHub repository: 

1. You can browse to the directory of the lecture you would like to see the code for.
2. Clicking on the file (usually labeled as `Q#.py`, where `#` is the number of the question) will bring up the code from the question that you can then copy and paste into your IDE of choice to play around with.
3. Alternatively, you can use the green `CODE` button at the top of the [main repo page](https://github.com/rfulkerson/25fall1400) to download a ZIP file of the entire directory structure.

For students who may be familiar with GitHub repositories: have at it! :)
